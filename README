# Advent of Code

I heard about Advent of code last year from my friend and I thought it sounded very fun. I'm excited to follow along this year!

I was picking between C, C++, and Julia. I decided to go with C++. I thought C would be overkill and not necessarily as useful to me. And Julia might be too powerful for the type of problems. C++ strikes the balance between usefulness and power that made sense for me this year.
